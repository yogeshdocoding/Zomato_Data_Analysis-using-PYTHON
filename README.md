# Zomato_Data_Analysis-using-PYTHON

This project takes a deep dive into Zomato restaurant data to spot trends and understand customer preferences. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we cleaned the data, created visualizations, and pulled out meaningful insights to help make smarter business decisions.

### What We Did
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and making sure everything was accurate.
   - Dealt with any missing values so our analysis stayed on point.

2. **Exploring the Data:**
   - Visualized different types of restaurants and how common they are.
   - Checked how many places offer online ordering and which don’t.
   - Looked at how ratings and costs vary across different restaurants.

3. **Visual Storytelling:**
   - Used bar charts, count plots, and histograms to show category distributions.
   - Created heatmaps to find relationships between different features.

### What We Learned
- **Popular Restaurant Types:** Most restaurants are focused on dine-in services, showing people still love going out to eat.

- **Online Ordering:** A lot of places still don’t offer online ordering, which could be an opportunity for growth.
- **Ratings:** Ratings tend to sit around the mid-range, with fewer places getting extremely high or low scores.
- **Cost Trends:** The average cost for two people is usually around 300 rupees, making it a sweet spot for affordability.
- **Order Type & Ratings:** Restaurants that offer online orders often get better ratings than those that stick to offline orders.

### Final Thoughts
This project gave us a solid understanding of customer behavior and restaurant performance on Zomato. The insights we found can help restaurants improve their services, expand online ordering options, and set smarter pricing strategies.
